# ImagesConnector

Simple rust test program. connect images from two folders and add text to the final image.

ps: this was built as part of a calendar builder, so for now only adds static 2019 text with two colors brought from the top picture (first folder).

## Usage
```
./program path1 path2 export_path
```
* path1:         first folder path.
* path2:         second folder path.
* export_path:   folder where to save exported images.
